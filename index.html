            <div id="joining_moringa">
                I have always been fascinated with programming ever since I interacted with it in my first year of campus.
                However, I never got the chance to proceed with it until I finished university and enrolled in a two-months 
                bootcamp on HTML and CSS three years ago. The bootcamp was an eye-opener, triggering massive interest in the 
                subject. I joined Moringa School for the software development program following recommendations from friends 
                in the local IT field. Moreover, its partnership with renowned technology firms reinforces its leadership in 
                training programming courses, making it the best choice to help with changing my career.

        <h2>Github Projects</h2>
            <p>For the short term I have been in Moringa School, I have managed to work on at least four projects. They include:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="first_projects">
            <div id="favorite">
                <p>My Favorite Band Website. <a href="https://dennisnjeru9.github.io/my_favorite_band/" target="_blank">Click here</a></p>
                <p> 
                    This project involved creating a website of my favorite band, Linkin Park. It contains a list of my favorite 
                    hits from the band, their albums, and a short bio for each band member. Only HTML and CSS languages were used
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="anitas">
                <p>Anitas Kitchen Landing Page. <a href="https://dennisnjeru9.github.io/Anitas-Kitchen/" target="_blank">Click here</a></p>
                <p>
                    This project involved recreating the landing page of a restaurant called Anitas Kitchen. It contained a list
                    of drinks and foods served at the restaurant, contacts, and testimonials. The main langauges used were HTML and CSS
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="dairy">
                <p>Dairy Business Website. <a href="https://dennisnjeru9.github.io/Dairy_Business/" target="_blank">Click here</a></p>
                <p>
                    This project entailed creating a website for monitoring my dairy business. The contents included daily and monthly
                    production rates, daily earnings, monthly earnings, and annual earnings. It incorporates HTML, CSS, and JS langauges.
                </p>

        <div class="second_projects">

                <p>Share Feedback Website. <a href="https://clarelimo.github.io/Share-Feedback/" target="_blank">Click here</a></p>
                <p>
                    This was a collaborative project involving four members. Basically Share Feedback is a website that works with testers
                    to give product feedback to manufacturers and creators. It has a client and tester side.

                <p>
                    This project includes the creation of a porfolio landing page. Here I shared a few things about me, particularly education
                    job experience, reasons for joining programming school, github projects, and hobbies/interests.
