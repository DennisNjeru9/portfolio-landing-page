                        I have always been fascinated with programming ever since I interacted with it in my first year of campus.<br>
                        However, I never got the chance to proceed with it until I finished university and enrolled in a two-months <br>
                        bootcamp on HTML and CSS three years ago. The bootcamp was an eye-opener, triggering massive interest in the <br>
                        subject. I joined Moringa School for the software development program following recommendations from friends <br>
                        in the local IT field. Moreover, its partnership with renowned technology firms reinforces its leadership in <br>
                        training programming courses, making it the best choice to help with changing my career.
