                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I have always been fascinated with programming ever since I interacted with it in my first year of campus.<br>
                        However, I never got the chance to proceed with it until I finished university and enrolled in a two-months <br>
                        bootcamp on HTML and CSS three years ago. The bootcamp was an eye-opener, triggering massive interest in the <br>
                        subject. I joined Moringa School for the software development program following recommendations from friends <br>
                        in the local IT field. Moreover, its partnership with renowned technology firms reinforces its leadership in <br>
                        training programming courses, making it the best choice to help with changing my career.

                    <h2>Github Projects</h2>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>For the short term I have been in Moringa School, I have managed to work on at least four projects. They include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>My Favorite Band Website. <a href="https://dennisnjeru9.github.io/my_favorite_band/">Click here</a></li>
                        <p> 
                            This project involved creating a website of my favorite band, Linkin Park. It contains a list of my favorite <br>
                            hits from the band, their albums, and a short bio for each band member. Only HTML and CSS languages were used
                        </p>
                        <li>Anitas Kitchen Landing Page. <a href="https://dennisnjeru9.github.io/Anitas-Kitchen/">Click here</a></li>
                        <p>
                            This project involved recreating the landing page of a restaurant called Anitas Kitchen. It contained a list <br>
                            of drinks and foods served at the restaurant, contacts, and testimonials. The main langauges used were HTML and CSS
                        </p>
                        <li>Dairy Business Website. <a href="https://dennisnjeru9.github.io/Dairy_Business/">Click here</a></li>
                        <p>
                            This project entailed creating a website for monitoring my dairy business. The contents included daily and monthly <br>
                            production rates, daily earnings, monthly earnings, and annual earnings. It incorporates HTML, CSS, and JS langauges.
                        </p>
                        <li>Share Feedback Website. <a href="https://clarelimo.github.io/Share-Feedback/">Click here</a></li>
                        <p>
                            This was a collaborative project involving four members. Basically Share Feedback is a website that works with testers <br>
                            to give product feedback to manufacturers and creators. It has a client and tester side.
                        </p>
                        <li>My Portfolio. <a href="https://dennisnjeru9.github.io/portfolio-landing-page/">Click here</a></li>
                        <p>
                            This project includes the creation of a porfolio landing page. Here I shared a few things about me, particularly education <br>
                            job experience, reasons for joining programming school, github projects, and hobbies/interests.
                        </p>
